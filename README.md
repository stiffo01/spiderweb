# spiderweb

This is a school project for learning bash scripts
Spiderweb is a bash script that should look for connections on a web port and serve a website to that port.

The web server is a script that opens port 80 on a public ip. It should be able to deliver html documents from a local
directory to any connecting web browser. What you should see whe you connect to the server where the script is running
with firefox, is the html document that resides on the server, and is served up by the script. The html document should
support links to other html documents residing on the same server. For bonus points, implement username/password
authentication as well.
